\chapter*{Abstract}

The purpose of this thesis is to introduce the process of creating modular 3d assets pack basing on previously drawn concept art and ready to be imported to 3d game engine. Particular emphasis will be placed on technical aspects of this process. Additionally, some major advantages and disadvantages of this process will be shown. \newline
Dissertation consists of six chapters, including this abstract.\newline\indent
First chapter contains introduction with short story of 3d graphics in computer games and highlights technology used to pursue the given goal.\newline\indent
Second chapter covers the potential optimization techniques of the process and 3d assets. Additionally, each of them has real-life examples given by game development companies and potential benefits of using it included. \newline\indent
Next part of this thesis shows the example of how asset creation process can be implemented in team of game developers from early preproduction phase to final level in target engine. \newline\indent
Fourth chapter covers specific implementation of modular assets creation process. It shows the whole process from inspirations and concept art phase to final adjustments in scene lighting. The whole process was executed in Unreal Engine 4. \newline\indent
Finally, last part of this dissertation shows major advantages and disadvantages of using modular asset creation process.
